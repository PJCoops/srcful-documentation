Srcful is a revolutionary platform that aims to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system. Our main goal is to address the barriers to entry for renewable energy, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology, and high upfront costs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/participate":{"id":"getting-started/participate","title":"Participate","description":"There are two primary ways to get involved with Srcful and start participating in the energy revolution at this stage:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/setting-up":{"id":"getting-started/setting-up","title":"Setting up","description":"The Solana Wallet","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/troubleshooting":{"id":"getting-started/troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","description":"Energy Gateway","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/using":{"id":"getting-started/using","title":"Using Srcful","description":"PoS","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Srcful Documentation","description":"On this documentation site, you will find all the information you need to start using Srcful\'s technology to participate in shaping the future of energy. Our documentation covers everything from the Srcful Gateway to API documentation and other developer resources.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"sustainability/environment":{"id":"sustainability/environment","title":"environment","description":"Srcful is dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment, and promoting the use of sustainable energy sources is a key part of this commitment. One of the ways Srcful is working to achieve this is by offering incentives to encourage the development and implementation of solar and other sustainable power sources. By providing financial support for these initiatives, Srcful aims to increase the use of renewable energy sources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tokenomics/incentive":{"id":"tokenomics/incentive","title":"Incentive Structure","description":"Srcful\'s incentive model for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the decentralized energy grid consists of two key components: Proof-of-Source (PoS) and Proof-of-Control (PoC). PoS rewards DER owners for validating their energy source and connecting their DER to the Srcful network, while PoC is an optional feature that allows Srcful to sell the energy generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. Together, these features create a more sustainable and decentralized energy system and provide additional incentives for DER owners to contribute to the energy marketplace.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tokenomics/tokenomics":{"id":"tokenomics/tokenomics","title":"Distribution","description":"The Srcful tokenomic distribution plan outlines how the total supply of SrcToken will be distributed over a period of 30 years. The plan aims to create a fair and equitable distribution of tokens that promotes decentralization and encourages widespread adoption of the Srcful platform.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/energy-gateway":{"id":"whitepaper/energy-gateway","title":"Srcful Energy Gateway","description":"The Energy Gateway developed by Srcful is a state-of-the-art Internet of Things (IoT) device that is designed to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid. The Energy Gateway communicates directly with PV-inverters or battery storage systems through the use of the Modbus protocol, allowing for the transfer of data and control signals between the device and the energy generation or storage system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/energy-market":{"id":"whitepaper/energy-market","title":"The Energy Market","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/executive-summery":{"id":"whitepaper/executive-summery","title":"Executive Summery","description":"The main problems that Srcful aims to address are barriers to entry for renewable energy, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology, and high upfront costs. Srcful will create a community powered virtual power plant (VPP) through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) combined with the SRC-token. This new approach allows individuals to take control of their energy resources, contribute to the grid and shape the development of next-generation energy services through a community-driven approach. This will inject decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies, unleash innovation and make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/problems-to-solve":{"id":"whitepaper/problems-to-solve","title":"Problems to Solve","description":"Srcful aims to address several key challenges in the energy market, including barriers to entry, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology and costs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/solution":{"id":"whitepaper/solution","title":"The Solution","description":"Remove barriers to enter","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
