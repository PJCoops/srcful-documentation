With Proof-of-Source, users can earn rewards for their green energy contributions when a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) produces green energy and is validated through the Srcful network. Proof-of-Control provides an additional way for DER owners to earn rewards by allowing Srcful to sell the power generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. The balancing authorities purchase clusters of DERs, and payments for power sold by Srcful are used to buy and burn SRC tokens. By participating in Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control, users can contribute to a sustainable energy system and earn rewards for their contributions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Srcful Documentation","description":"Participate in shaping the future of energy with Srcful\'s technology","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"roadmap":{"id":"roadmap","title":"Roadmap","description":"In this section of the documentation, you will find the Srcful Roadmap, a comprehensive overview of our current development initiatives and future plans.
