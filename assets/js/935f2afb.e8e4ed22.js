Its luminosity illuminates the depths of space, beckoning us to consider the limitless potential for renewable energy in our universe. As we gaze upon its radiance, we are reminded of the urgency to embrace sustainable energy practices on Earth, to harness the power of the sun and all the natural resources available to us, and to continue our pursuit of a brighter, greener future.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"for-dummies":{"id":"for-dummies","title":"Srcful for dummies","description":"Where you sent here by someone or are you just feeling overwhelmed by all the information about Srcful? Don\'t worry, you\'re not alone! Srcful is a complex network that can be hard to understand, even for experts. That\'s why we\'ve created this page for people who are new to the concept.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/introduction":{"id":"getting-started/introduction","title":"Introduction to Srcful","description":"Welcome to the Srcful Getting Started guide! Srcful is a revolutionary platform that aims to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system. Our main goal is to address the barriers to entry for renewable energy, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology, and high upfront costs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/participate":{"id":"getting-started/participate","title":"Participate","description":"There are two primary ways to get involved with Srcful and start participating in the energy revolution at this stage:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/setting-up":{"id":"getting-started/setting-up","title":"Setting up","description":"The Solana Wallet","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/troubleshooting":{"id":"getting-started/troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","description":"Energy Gateway","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/using":{"id":"getting-started/using","title":"Using Srcful","description":"The Srcful platform incentivizes users to contribute to a sustainable and decentralized energy system through two models: Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control. With Proof-of-Source, users can earn rewards for their green energy contributions when a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) produces green energy and is validated through the Srcful network. Proof-of-Control provides an additional way for DER owners to earn rewards by allowing Srcful to sell the power generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. The balancing authorities purchase clusters of DERs, and payments for power sold by Srcful are used to buy and burn SRC tokens, benefiting all token holders. By participating in Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control, users can contribute to a sustainable energy system and earn rewards for their contributions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview":{"id":"overview","title":"Srcful Documentation","description":"Ready to start using Srcful\'s technology to participate in shaping the future of energy? Our documentation covers everything from the Srcful Gateway to API documentation and other developer resources.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"sustainability/blockchain":{"id":"sustainability/blockchain","title":"Blockchain and Crypto","description":"The use of blockchain technology has been the subject of much debate in terms of its environmental impact. It\'s true that some blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin, rely on a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism that requires a large amount of computing power and energy consumption to validate transactions. This has led to concerns about the carbon footprint of PoW blockchains.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"sustainability/environment":{"id":"sustainability/environment","title":"Environment","description":"Srcful is dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment, and promoting the use of sustainable energy sources is a key part of this commitment. One of the ways Srcful is working to achieve this is by offering incentives to encourage the development and implementation of solar and other sustainable power sources. By providing financial support for these initiatives, Srcful aims to increase the use of renewable energy sources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"sustainability/introduction":{"id":"sustainability/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Understanding Renewable Energy","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tokenomics/distribution":{"id":"tokenomics/distribution","title":"Distribution","description":"Read more about the SRC-token in our Whitepaper.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tokenomics/incentive":{"id":"tokenomics/incentive","title":"Incentive Structure","description":"Srcful\'s incentive model for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to the decentralized energy grid consists of two key components: Proof-of-Source and Proof-of-Control. Proof-of-Source rewards DER owners for validating their energy source and connecting their DER to the Srcful network, while PoC is an optional feature that allows Srcful to sell the energy generated by the DER on the flexibility grid service markets. Together, these features create a more sustainable and decentralized energy system and provide additional incentives for DER owners to contribute to the energy marketplace.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/adoption-implementation":{"id":"whitepaper/adoption-implementation","title":"Implementation","description":"Identify potential users of Srcful: The first step in implementing Srcful is to identify potential users of the platform. These includes individuals with solar panel or battery systems.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/challenges":{"id":"whitepaper/challenges","title":"Challenges","description":"Like any technological system, the energy gateway developed by Srcful is not without its challenges and limitations. Some potential challenges and limitations that the energy gateway may face include:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/energy-gateway":{"id":"whitepaper/energy-gateway","title":"Srcful Energy Gateway","description":"The Energy Gateway developed by Srcful is a state-of-the-art Internet of Things (IoT) device that is designed to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid. The Energy Gateway communicates directly with PV-inverters or battery storage systems through the use of the Modbus protocol, allowing for the transfer of data and control signals between the device and the energy generation or storage system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/executive-summery":{"id":"whitepaper/executive-summery","title":"Executive Summary","description":"The main problems that Srcful aims to address are barriers to entry for renewable energy, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology, and high upfront costs. Srcful will create a community powered virtual power plant (VPP) through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs) combined with the SRC-token. This new approach allows individuals to take control of their energy resources, contribute to the grid and shape the development of next-generation energy services through a community-driven approach. This will inject decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies, unleash innovation and make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/potential":{"id":"whitepaper/potential","title":"Potential","description":"Srcful offers a decentralized energy system that utilizes blockchain, distributed energy resources, and the Internet of Things to revolutionize the energy industry. The possibilities of this innovative technology extend far beyond the current energy market, and the Srcful platform can be used in a variety of different ways. On this page, we\'ll explore three potential use cases for the Srcful system: flexibility services, guarantee of origin, and peer-to-peer energy trading. Each of these use cases demonstrates the power and potential of the Srcful platform to drive the transition towards renewable energy and a more sustainable future.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/problems-to-solve":{"id":"whitepaper/problems-to-solve","title":"Problems to Solve","description":"Srcful aims to address several key challenges in the energy market, including barriers to entry, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology and costs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/solution":{"id":"whitepaper/solution","title":"The Solution","description":"Remove barriers to enter","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/src-token":{"id":"whitepaper/src-token","title":"SRC-token","description":"Type: SPL Token on Solana","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
