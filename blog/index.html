DERs, like solar panels and batteries, are playing a key role in reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and promoting energy independence. In this post, we&#x27;ll discuss the benefits of DERs in the context of the energy industry.</p><p>First and foremost, DERs help to reduce carbon emissions. By generating energy from renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydro, DERs help to reduce the amount of carbon emissions produced by the energy industry. This is critical for addressing the global climate crisis and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p>Secondly, DERs can help to increase energy efficiency. By generating energy closer to the point of use, DERs reduce the amount of energy lost during transmission and distribution. This makes the energy system more efficient and reduces the need for expensive upgrades to the energy grid.</p><p>Finally, DERs promote energy independence. By generating energy locally, home owners can become less reliant on the traditional energy system, which is subject to price volatility and power outages. This promotes greater energy security and resilience, and can help to reduce energy costs over the long-term.</p><p>At Srcful, we&#x27;re committed to promoting the use of DERs by creating a decentralized platform that enables home owners to participate in the energy market and earn crypto rewards. By using DERs, home owners can reduce their carbon footprint, increase their energy efficiency, and promote energy independence.</p><p>In summary, the benefits of DERs are clear. They help to reduce carbon emissions, increase energy efficiency, and promote energy independence. By using DERs and participating in the energy market through platforms like Srcful, home owners can contribute to a more sustainable and decentralized energy system.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/2023/01/16/">Secure and Transparent Energy Transactions with Srcful</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-01-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">January 16, 2023</time> Â· <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/DMozartAndraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/davmoz.png" alt="David Mozart Andraws"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/DMozartAndraws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">David Mozart Andraws</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Crunches hardware</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As the lead hardware engineer at Srcful, I&#x27;m excited to share with you an overview of our platform&#x27;s architecture. At Srcful, we&#x27;re leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create a decentralized platform that enables home owners to participate in the energy market and earn crypto rewards.</p><p>One of the key challenges of creating a decentralized platform is ensuring that the devices are up-to-date and secure. To address this challenge, we&#x27;re using OTA (over-the-air) updates to keep the firmware of the Srcful Energy Gateway up-to-date.

When combined, they have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including the energy industry. In this post, we&#x27;ll provide a high-level overview of blockchain technology and the IoT and how they are used in the context of Srcful.</p><p>Let&#x27;s start with blockchain technology. At its core, a blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger that allows for secure and transparent transactions. In the context of energy transactions, blockchain technology can provide a secure and transparent way to transact energy data and rewards. By using blockchain technology, we can create a tamper-proof and immutable record of all transactions, which ensures that data is secure and transparent.</p><p>We have chosen Solana as the blockchain for our Src-token, because it is a high-performance blockchain that can handle a large number of transactions per second, and is highly scalable. Our use of Solana means that our platform can operate at a high speed and can handle the large volume of energy transactions that will be processed.</p><p>IoT refers to a network of interconnected devices that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that enable them to collect and exchange data. In the context of energy transactions, IoT devices can provide a way to monitor, control, and optimize energy resources in real-time.</p><p>At Srcful, we have developed an Energy Gateway that is equipped with a crypto chip, which allows for secure communication with the blockchain. The Energy Gateway is also compatible with Helium (LoRaWAN), which enables us to use Helium for verification and some data transfer. This means that we can provide a digital identity to distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar panels and batteries, which enables them to transact and prove their energy data on the blockchain.</p><p>The benefits of using blockchain and the IoT for energy transactions and data management are clear. They provide a secure, transparent, and efficient way to manage energy resources and rewards. By using these technologies, we can create a more decentralized and sustainable grid that empowers home owners to participate in the energy market and earn crypto rewards.</p><p>In summary, blockchain technology and the IoT are two powerful technologies that can revolutionize the energy industry. At Srcful, we&#x27;re leveraging these technologies to create a platform that enables home owners to participate in the energy market and monetize their contributions. By using Solana as the blockchain for our Src-token, and our Energy Gateway with Helium for verification and data transfer, we&#x27;re creating a secure and transparent platform that will transform the energy industry.</p></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/future-of-energy">The Future of Energy</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-12-03T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 3, 2022</time> Â· <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://twitter.com/SrcfulViktor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1621364087971094528/neraFF44_400x400.jpg" alt="Viktor"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://twitter.com/SrcfulViktor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Viktor</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Business developer and CFO</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-blockchain-and-iot-can-create-a-more-sustainable-energy-system">How Blockchain and IoT Can Create a More Sustainable Energy System<a href="#how-blockchain-and-iot-can-create-a-more-sustainable-energy-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Blockchain and IoT Can Create a More Sustainable Energy System" title="Direct link to How Blockchain and IoT Can Create a More Sustainable Energy System">â</a></h2><p>The energy industry is undergoing a significant transformation, and the need for a more decentralized and sustainable grid has never been greater.
